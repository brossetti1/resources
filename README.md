# Resources

public repo of resources for transitioning to web3. Feel free to open an issue to suggest your favorites.

## Standard Docs

- [ethereum org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/) - ethereum org has a ton of resources and explainations on what web3 is.
- [Solidity Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/) - solidity docs - make sure to read through these
- [Open Zepplin](https://openzeppelin.com/) - openzepplin creates a lot of patterns that are safe to use - gold standard for alot of contracts, I find reading the code in their repo is much more revealing than reading their docs; reading both is preferred.
- [ethersjs](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) - base library for working with web3
- [EIPS](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS) - Ethereum Improvement proposals - standard implementations and improvements for ethereum (ill try to ping people for the most useful eips to understand - openzepplin will also have good references for EIPS)

## Code References

- [uniswap](https://github.com/Uniswap) - largely known as some of the best code structures and programmers in the space - although their code is quiet technical.
- [ENS](https://github.com/ensdomains) - again, some of the best programmers in the space
- [nouns.wtf](https://github.com/nounsDAO/) - on chain svg nft framework - in my opinion, their code is super clean and you can see an entire web3 app and how it implemented by tracking through their packages.
- [Eth Scaffold](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth) - large community working on example projects for the space to fork and run with - see branches for all examples - i like their project structure but their code is scattered at times. great community to join and get mentorship and build quickly.
